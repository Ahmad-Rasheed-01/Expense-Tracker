# Expense Tracker
## Link to the webpage
[Expense Tracker](https://expense-record-tracker.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}
## Overview
I built this webpage to help youngsters, sepecially students at college and university to keep a track of their daily expenditures and then ultimately manage their student more easily rather than sitting free handed at mid or end of the month. It is now live and you can check it out from the link I provided above. I admit that it is still in its immature stages and many  options are still not available and many of the improvements can be made to escalate the productivity of this project.

Contributions are highly appreciated here.

## Event
I have bring this idea into real world on the occasion of:
#### Hackmakers World Innovation Day Hack 2023 Hackathon
